# Multi-threaded-Book-Order-System

A multithreaded book order simulation program that uses mutexes and thread coordination. It is a producer consumer program with a single producer and multiple consumers. The producer and the consumers will run as separate threads, so mutexes are used to protect and manage shared data structures.
